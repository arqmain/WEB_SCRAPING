 # Data Science: IBM Employment Jobs Offers 

On this project, we deal with an application of DATA MINING to the internet IBM Jobs portal “Jobs at IBM” in order to dig and get information about the jobs offers for 14 countries worldwide.

The target population corresponds to the jobs offers for each of the 14 countries in the IBM database (5954 jobs).

I use the rvest r package and a double and nested for loop script to get all the information from the website. This script allows capturing the data quickly from all the pages throughout the website.

For the treatment of the text (characters) and date, the “stringr”, “lubridate”, and “tidyr” libraries are preferably used through many of the functions that both incorporate.

The data wrangling and data processing are covered with various libraries but, preferably, dplyr, tydiverse and ggpubr are used. The visualization of the results is generated through ggplot2 or some of its extensions, gridextra, and Power BI.

The specifics objectives are:

1) To web scrape the site in order to get the full database available online.
2) To obtain interesting results by performing data management and getting visualizations with a tabular backup.
