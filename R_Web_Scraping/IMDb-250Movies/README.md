Actualized format of the presentation made in the month of June 2019, at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Maule (UCM) to students of the Engineering in Statistics career (recently created), managers, and faculty.

This presentation provides a broad, very informative and accurate view of the subject. At the end of the presentation, the audience leaves with a clear vision of each of the treated topics, their interrelation, dependence, and independence respectively. The presentation is complemented with a summary exposition of the state of the art of the subject in general, and a couple of examples of direct application of recent data.
